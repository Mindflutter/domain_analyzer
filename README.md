Domain Analyzer
===============

An application that retrieves certain information from remote hosts via HTTP.

Further improvements
--------------------
This is just a prototype, so here is a list of possible improvements / features / things to do:

* Provide command line argument parsing, so that users could feed in whitelist and regex list for example as a file
* Make default values configurable, parse it with ConfigParser
* Cover the codebase with tests, where it makes sense
* Provide proper packaging with setup.py
